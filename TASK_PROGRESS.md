2. âœ… Created realistic mock data with 5 students, 2 teachers, 7 locations, and sample passes
3. âœ… Built helper functions for data access and filtering
4. âœ… Implemented the core state machine (OPEN/CLOSED, IN/OUT)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Complete data model with User, Location, Pass, EventLog interfaces
- `src/lib/mockData.ts` - Realistic school scenario data with helper functions
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Reusable Button component
- `src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Card component for displaying information
- `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component for status indicators
- `src/components/PassStatus.tsx` - Component showing current pass status
- `src/components/CreatePassForm.tsx` - Form for creating new passes
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete student dashboard with full functionality

**Core Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Student can declare where they're going (bathroom, nurse, office, etc.)
- âœ… Visual status indicators (OPEN/CLOSED, IN/OUT) with color coding
- âœ… Pass lifecycle: Create â†’ Depart â†’ Arrive â†’ Return to Class
- âœ… Real-time updates with loading states

- âœ… **Complex Multi-leg Trip**: Student creates pass â†’ goes to library â†’ goes to restroom â†’ returns to library â†’ eventually returns to class
- âœ… **Single Loop Rule**: Restroom trips have one action ("I'm back in class"), supervised locations have two actions ("I've Arrived" + "I'm back in class")
- âœ… **Location Tracking**: System remembers last non-restroom location for proper return routing

**UI/UX Features:**

3.  âœ… Implemented `createPass` and `updatePass` functions to persist data in Firestore.
4.  âœ… Added data conversion utilities to handle Firestore Timestamps.
5.  âœ… Created a developer tool page (`/dev-tools`) for migrating mock user and location data into Firestore.
6.  âœ… Added environment variable checks to ensure the app fails gracefully if Firebase configuration is missing.

---

2.  âœ… Created a secure authentication flow where only registered users can access the application.
3.  âœ… Added role-based access control, limiting access to users with the `student` role and providing a `dev` role for testing.
4.  âœ… Implemented a "Dev Mode" to allow developers to impersonate a test student for easier debugging.
5.  âœ… Added necessary security configurations (`vercel.json`, authorized domains in Firebase) to ensure authentication works correctly in the Vercel production environment.

---

## Phase 5: The Core State Machine

### âœ… Task 5.1: State Machine Refactoring - COMPLETED
1.  âœ… Refactored the core state machine logic out of UI components into a dedicated, testable module (`src/lib/stateMachine.ts`).
2.  âœ… Created a service layer (`src/lib/passService.ts`) to handle Firebase operations and coordinate with the state machine.
3.  âœ… Refactored the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to use the new service layer instead of direct state machine calls.
4.  âœ… Added comprehensive Jest tests for the state machine (`src/lib/__tests__/stateMachine.test.ts`) covering all state transitions and edge cases.
5.  âœ… Fixed initial test failures by adjusting validation order in the state machine.
6.  âœ… All tests now pass successfully, ensuring the state machine logic is robust and reliable.
7.  âœ… Tagged and released as `v0.5.0` to mark the completion of Phase 5.

**Technical Achievements:**
- âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: State machine logic is now isolated from UI components
- âœ… **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite covering all state transitions
- âœ… **Maintainability**: Clean service layer abstraction for Firebase operations
- âœ… **Reliability**: All edge cases and validation scenarios are tested
- âœ… **Documentation**: Clear interfaces and method documentation

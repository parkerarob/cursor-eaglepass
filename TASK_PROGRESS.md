# Eagle Pass - Task Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation & "Hello World"

### âœ… Task 1.1: Project Setup & Environment - COMPLETED

**What we accomplished:**
1. âœ… Initialized a Next.js project with TypeScript
2. âœ… Set up TailwindCSS for styling
3. âœ… Installed and configured ShadCN UI components
4. âœ… Set up Firebase project configuration (dev environment)
5. âœ… Configured basic project structure

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/lib/firebase/config.ts` - Firebase configuration with environment variables
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for Eagle Pass data model
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Simple homepage with "Eagle Pass" branding
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `.env.local` - Environment variables template
- Project structure with organized directories

**Next Steps:**
Ready for **Task 1.2: Deploy "Hello World"** - Create a simple webpage and deploy to Vercel

### âœ… Task 1.2: Deploy "Hello World" - COMPLETED
Successfully deployed the initial application to Vercel, establishing the CI/CD pipeline and production environment.

## Phase 2: Understanding Data (Days 4-7)

### âœ… Task 2.1: Data Models & Mock Data - COMPLETED

**What we accomplished:**
1. âœ… Expanded TypeScript data models for core entities (Users, Locations, Passes, EventLogs)
2. âœ… Created realistic mock data with 5 students, 2 teachers, 7 locations, and sample passes
3. âœ… Built helper functions for data access and filtering
4. âœ… Implemented the core state machine (OPEN/CLOSED, IN/OUT)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Complete data model with User, Location, Pass, EventLog interfaces
- `src/lib/mockData.ts` - Realistic school scenario data with helper functions
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Reusable Button component
- `src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Card component for displaying information
- `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component for status indicators
- `src/components/PassStatus.tsx` - Component showing current pass status
- `src/components/CreatePassForm.tsx` - Form for creating new passes
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete student dashboard with full functionality

**Core Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Student can declare where they're going (bathroom, nurse, office, etc.)
- âœ… Visual status indicators (OPEN/CLOSED, IN/OUT) with color coding
- âœ… Pass lifecycle: Create â†’ Depart â†’ Arrive â†’ Return to Class
- âœ… Real-time updates with loading states
- âœ… Modern, student-friendly UI with emojis and clear messaging
- âœ… Multi-leg pass support for complex movement patterns
- âœ… Simple restroom trip logic (most common use case)
- âœ… Dark mode support with theme toggle
- âœ… Responsive design with beautiful UI/UX

**MVP State Machine Logic:**
- âœ… **Simple Restroom Trip**: Student creates pass â†’ goes to restroom â†’ returns to class â†’ pass closes
- âœ… **Complex Multi-leg Trip**: Student creates pass â†’ goes to library â†’ goes to restroom â†’ returns to library â†’ eventually returns to class
- âœ… **Single Loop Rule**: Restroom trips have one action ("I'm back in class"), supervised locations have two actions ("I've Arrived" + "I'm back in class")
- âœ… **Location Tracking**: System remembers last non-restroom location for proper return routing

**UI/UX Features:**
- âœ… Clean, modern interface with ShadCN components
- âœ… Dark/light mode toggle with system preference detection
- âœ… Loading states and smooth transitions
- âœ… Intuitive button placement and text
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design
- âœ… Professional color scheme and typography

**Technical Achievements:**
- âœ… TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- âœ… ESLint configuration with no warnings
- âœ… Production build optimization
- âœ… Component-based architecture
- âœ… Mock data system ready for Firebase integration
- âœ… Git repository with clean commit history
- âœ… Vercel deployment ready

**Next Steps:**
Ready for **Phase 3: Real Data Storage** - Connect to Firebase and implement real data persistence

---

## Phase 3: Real Data Storage

### âœ… Task 3.1: Firebase Integration - COMPLETED
1.  âœ… Connected the application to a live Firebase Firestore database.
2.  âœ… Replaced all mock data functions with live Firestore calls (`getStudentById`, `getLocationById`, `getActivePassByStudentId`, etc.).
3.  âœ… Implemented `createPass` and `updatePass` functions to persist data in Firestore.
4.  âœ… Added data conversion utilities to handle Firestore Timestamps.
5.  âœ… Created a developer tool page (`/dev-tools`) for migrating mock user and location data into Firestore.
6.  âœ… Added environment variable checks to ensure the app fails gracefully if Firebase configuration is missing.

---

## Phase 4: Authentication & Security

### âœ… Task 4.1: Google SSO & Role-Based Access - COMPLETED
1.  âœ… Implemented Google Single Sign-On (SSO) using Firebase Authentication.
2.  âœ… Created a secure authentication flow where only registered users can access the application.
3.  âœ… Added role-based access control, limiting access to users with the `student` role and providing a `dev` role for testing.
4.  âœ… Implemented a "Dev Mode" to allow developers to impersonate a test student for easier debugging.
5.  âœ… Added necessary security configurations (`vercel.json`, authorized domains in Firebase) to ensure authentication works correctly in the Vercel production environment.
6.  âœ… Created a clean login page and integrated sign-out functionality.

## Current Status

**ðŸŽ‰ Eagle Pass now has a live database and secure authentication!**

The application has been successfully migrated from mock data to a persistent Firestore database. The core pass lifecycle is fully functional with real data. We have also implemented a complete Google SSO authentication flow, ensuring that only authorized students (and developers in "dev mode") can access the application.

**Next Steps:**
Ready for **Phase 5: The Core State Machine**. We will refactor the state transition logic out of the UI components and into a dedicated, testable module to improve maintainability and prepare for more complex features.

    - Added parent relationship verification methods to FERPA service
    - Created API endpoints for parent relationship verification (/api/parent/verify-relationship)
    - Created API endpoints for parent relationship management (/api/parent/relationships)
    - Created API endpoints for directory information opt-outs (/api/parent/directory-info)
    - Enhanced ParentPortal React component with relationship management UI
    - Added directory information opt-out controls to parent portal
    - Created dedicated parent portal page (/parent)
    - Added comprehensive tests for ParentRelationshipVerifier and DirectoryInfoService
    - Fixed ESLint errors and build issues

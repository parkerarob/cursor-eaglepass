## Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Emergency Stabilization
- [x] TASK-000: Add production warnings
  - Added warning banner to README.md
  - Created DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKERS.md
  - Verified current state: Build passes, tests have issues, npm audit fails

### Phase 1: Security Critical
- [x] TASK-001: Secure Firebase Configuration
  - ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Firebase config uses NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables exposing credentials
  - LOCATION: src/lib/firebase/config.ts
  - STATUS: COMPLETED
  - FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
    - Created server-only Firebase config (config.server.ts)
    - Updated client config to use only public variables
    - Added environment variable validation
    - Installed firebase-admin package
    - Verified build passes with test environment variables
    - Confirmed no sensitive credentials in client bundle
    - Authentication flow ready for testing
- [x] TASK-002: Implement Persistent Rate Limiting
  - ISSUE IDENTIFIED: In-memory rate limiting resets on server restart
  - LOCATION: src/lib/rateLimiter.ts
  - STATUS: COMPLETED
  - FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
    - Installed Redis and redis client libraries
    - Created src/lib/rateLimiter.redis.ts for persistent rate limiting
    - Updated all usages and tests to use RedisRateLimiter
    - Added fallback to in-memory if Redis unavailable
    - Verified build passes and rate limiting persists
    - Penetration tests updated and run (Redis-based)
    - Note: Some unrelated test failures due to Firebase Auth in Node.js
- [x] TASK-003: Fix Firestore Security Rules
  - ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Firestore rule for preventing multiple open passes was ineffective
  - LOCATION: firestore.rules
  - STATUS: COMPLETED
  - FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
    - Created Cloud Function validatePassCreation to check for existing open passes
    - Updated Firestore rules to remove broken multiple pass check
    - Added server-side validation before pass creation
    - Created getPassValidationStatus function for UI feedback
    - Added cleanupExpiredPasses scheduled function for automatic pass closure
    - Fixed ESLint configuration conflicts with proper flat config
    - Successfully deployed Cloud Functions and Firestore rules
    - All functions deployed and operational
- [ ] TASK-004: Implement Session Management

### Phase 2: FERPA Compliance
- [ ] TASK-005: Enable Parent Relationship Verification
  - ISSUE IDENTIFIED: ParentRelationshipVerifier commented out
  - LOCATION: src/lib/ferpaService.ts
- [ ] TASK-006: Implement Directory Information Service

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] TASK-007: Setup Jest with Coverage Requirements

- Blocked: None
- Tomorrow: Begin TASK-004 (Implement Session Management)

## Technical Notes

### TASK-003 Implementation Details
- **Cloud Functions Created:**
  - `validatePassCreation`: Validates pass creation by checking for existing open passes
  - `getPassValidationStatus`: Returns pass validation status for UI feedback
  - `cleanupExpiredPasses`: Scheduled function that runs every hour to close expired passes
- **Firestore Rules Updated:**
  - Removed ineffective multiple pass prevention rule
  - Rely on server-side validation through Cloud Functions
- **ESLint Configuration:**
  - Resolved conflicts by creating proper flat config (eslint.config.js)
  - Configured to ignore compiled lib directory
  - Fixed unused parameter warnings with underscore prefix pattern
- **Deployment Status:**
  - All functions successfully deployed to Firebase
  - Firestore rules updated and active
  - No deployment blockers encountered

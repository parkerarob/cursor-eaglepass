## Data Model & Relationships

### Current User Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'student' | 'teacher' | 'admin' | 'dev';
  assignedLocationId?: string; // For students: their classroom
  schoolId?: string; // For teachers: their school
}
```

### Current Location Structure
```typescript
interface Location {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  locationType: 'classroom' | 'bathroom' | 'nurse' | 'office' | 'library' | 'cafeteria';
  responsiblePartyId?: string; // Teacher responsible for this location
}
```

### New Policy System Structure ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
```typescript
interface ClassroomPolicy {
  id: string; // Same as locationId
  locationId: string;
  ownerId: string; // Teacher's user ID
  rules: {
    studentLeave: 'Allow' | 'Require Approval' | 'Disallow';
    studentArrive: 'Allow' | 'Require Approval' | 'Disallow';
    teacherRequest: 'Allow' | 'Require Approval' | 'Disallow';
  };
  lastUpdatedAt: Date;
}

interface StudentPolicyOverride {
  id: string;
  locationId: string;
  studentId: string;
  rules: Partial<ClassroomPolicy['rules']>; // Can override one or all rules
  lastUpdatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Teacher-Student Relationships ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
The system now has explicit teacher-student assignment logic:
- **Teacher Assignment**: Teachers are assigned to classrooms via `assignedLocationId`
- **Student Assignment**: Students are assigned to classrooms via `assignedLocationId`
- **Responsibility Logic**: Teachers are responsible for students with matching `assignedLocationId`
- **Destination Tracking**: Teachers see passes where their classroom is a destination
- **Policy Ownership**: Teachers own classroom policies for their assigned location
- **Group Ownership**: Teachers can create and manage student groups

## Security & Permissions

### Current Firestore Rules
- **Students**: Can read their own data and create/update their own passes
- **Teachers**: Can read all student data, update passes, manage their classroom policies and groups
- **Admins**: Full access to all data and system controls

### Role-Based Routing
- **Students**: Redirected to `/` (student dashboard)
- **Teachers**: Redirected to `/teacher` (teacher dashboard)
- **Admins**: Redirected to `/admin` (admin dashboard)
- **Dev**: Can access all interfaces with role switching

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ **State Machine**: 100% coverage of all state transitions

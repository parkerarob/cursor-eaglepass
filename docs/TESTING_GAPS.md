# Testing Gaps
Last Updated: 2025-06-23

## Critical Gaps
- Test coverage below 80%
- Missing integration tests for pass creation, parent portal, and FERPA features
- No E2E tests
- No automated test coverage in CI/CD

## Untested Features
- Email/SMS notifications
- Performance under load
- Accessibility

## References
- See REMEDIATION_LOG.md for daily progress
- See review/CODEBASE_REVIEW_2024-12-19.md for full technical audit

## As of [today's date]

### ParentAccessService (src/lib/parentAccessService.ts)
- Status: COVERED
- All major methods have robust, passing tests:
  - submitAccessRequest
  - getStudentRecordsForParent
  - submitRecordCorrectionRequest
  - verifyParentStudentRelationship
  - getParentAccessRequests
  - getPendingAccessRequests
  - approveAccessRequest
- FERPA, security, and error/edge cases are all tested.

## Recent Milestone (2025-06-23)
- Static method testability issues with Jest/TypeScript fully resolved for DataRetentionService and similar modules
- Solution: public static methods, static initialization guard, delayed import in tests
- Policy and troubleshooting now documented in CODE_CONVENTIONS.md and AI_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md
- All tests passing (177/177)

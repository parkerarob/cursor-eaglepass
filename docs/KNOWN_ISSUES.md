# Known Issues and Limitations
Last Updated: 2025-06-23

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Deployment Blockers)

### 1. Persistent Rate Limiting (FIXED 2025-06-23)
- **Issue**: Previously, in-memory rate limiting was used; now Redis-based rate limiting is enforced in production logic.
- **Impact**: DDoS risk, pass abuse (now mitigated)
- **Reference**: REMEDIATION_LOG.md, src/lib/passService.ts

### 2. FERPA Compliance (PARTIAL)
- **Issue**: ParentRelationshipVerifier and DirectoryInfoService are only partially implemented; parent portal and audit logging are still being improved.
- **Impact**: Legal liability, privacy risk
- **Reference**: docs/FERPA_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md, src/lib/parentRelationshipVerifier.ts, src/lib/directoryInfoService.ts

### 3. Test Coverage (IN PROGRESS)
- **Issue**: Test coverage is below 80%; integration and E2E tests are missing.
- **Impact**: Undetected bugs, safety risk
- **Reference**: REMEDIATION_LOG.md, test coverage reports

### 4. Documentation Accuracy (IN PROGRESS)
- **Issue**: Many docs previously claimed production readiness and full compliance; now being updated for honesty.
- **Impact**: Legal/operational risk
- **Reference**: review/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_2024-12-19.md

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline (MISSING)
- **Issue**: No automated quality gates or deployment validation.
- **Impact**: Risk of regressions, unsafe deployments
- **Reference**: REMEDIATION_LOG.md

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES
- Console logging in production code
- Some error handling is inconsistent
- Performance monitoring and optimization not implemented
- Accessibility not tested

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES
- Some functions lack type safety
- Bundle size could be optimized
- Some mock services still in use

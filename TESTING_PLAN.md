# Eagle Pass - Phase 6 Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for Eagle Pass Phase 6: Real-World Testing. The goal is to validate that the system works correctly in actual school environments and gather feedback for final improvements.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Functional Validation**: Ensure all features work as intended in real-world conditions
2. **User Experience**: Validate that the interface is intuitive and efficient for students and teachers
3. **Performance**: Confirm the system handles concurrent users and typical school loads
4. **Reliability**: Identify and fix any bugs or edge cases
5. **Security**: Verify that authentication and data access controls work properly

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Student Workflows

- **Steps**:
  1. Student logs in with Google SSO
  2. Student creates a pass to the bathroom
  3. Student completes the trip and returns to class
  4. Pass closes automatically
- **Expected Result**: Pass lifecycle completes successfully
- **Success Criteria**: No errors, proper state transitions, data persistence

#### 1.2 Multi-Leg Trip
- **Objective**: Test complex movement patterns
- **Steps**:
  1. Student creates pass to library
  2. Student arrives at library
  3. Student creates new pass to bathroom while at library
  4. Student returns to library after bathroom
  5. Student eventually returns to class
- **Expected Result**: All legs tracked correctly, proper return routing
- **Success Criteria**: Location history maintained, appropriate actions available

#### 1.3 Nurse Visit
- **Objective**: Test supervised location workflow
- **Steps**:
  1. Student creates pass to nurse
  2. Student arrives at nurse
  3. Student returns to class
- **Expected Result**: Two-step process (arrive + return) works correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Proper state management, clear user guidance

### 2. Teacher/Staff Workflows

#### 2.1 Dev Mode Testing
- **Objective**: Validate developer impersonation works

  1. Dev user logs in
  2. System loads test student profile
  3. Dev can perform all student actions
- **Expected Result**: Dev mode functions correctly
- **Success Criteria**: Clear dev mode indicators, full functionality

#### 2.2 Pass Monitoring
- **Objective**: Test pass visibility and management
- **Steps**:
  1. Teacher observes student pass creation
  2. Teacher monitors pass status
  3. Teacher can assist with pass closure if needed
- **Expected Result**: Teachers can effectively monitor student movement
- **Success Criteria**: Clear status visibility, appropriate access controls

### 3. System Performance

#### 3.1 Concurrent Users
- **Objective**: Test system under load
- **Steps**:
  1. Multiple students create passes simultaneously
  2. Monitor system responsiveness
  3. Check for race conditions or conflicts
- **Expected Result**: System remains responsive and accurate
- **Success Criteria**: No data corruption, acceptable response times

#### 3.2 Network Conditions
- **Objective**: Test under various network conditions
- **Steps**:
  1. Test with slow internet connection
  2. Test with intermittent connectivity
  3. Test offline behavior and recovery
- **Expected Result**: Graceful handling of network issues
- **Success Criteria**: Clear error messages, data integrity maintained

### 4. Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Invalid Actions
- **Objective**: Test system validation
- **Steps**:
  1. Attempt to create pass when one already exists
  2. Try to perform invalid state transitions
  3. Test with missing or invalid data
- **Expected Result**: System prevents invalid actions
- **Success Criteria**: Clear error messages, no data corruption

#### 4.2 Session Management
- **Objective**: Test authentication edge cases
- **Steps**:
  1. Test session timeout behavior
  2. Test multiple browser tabs
  3. Test logout and re-login scenarios
- **Expected Result**: Proper session handling
- **Success Criteria**: Secure authentication, consistent state
